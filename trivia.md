* [Sign up for their mailing list](http://www.geekswhodrink.com/pages/weekly-mailing-list#Texas) if you want to receive some hints about the quiz categories for that night in your inbox. Our hint: category titles are intentionally deceptive. Think outside the box!
* Popular question categories include but are not limited to current events, geography/landmarks, politics, sports, pop culture, music (mostly from 60s-early 00s), movies/TV (mostly from 80s to present) & celebrities. The final round is literally "random knowledge." Whether you think so or not, your brain will be an asset to your team!
* You don't need to sign up to play, but we'd appreciate a heads up if you're going to attend and play with other Codeup students so we can plan team sizes accordingly
